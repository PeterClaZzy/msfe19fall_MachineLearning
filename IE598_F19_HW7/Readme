Using the ccdefault dataset, and 10 fold cross validation described in Raschka; 
Part 1: Random forest estimators
Fit a random forest model, try several different values for N_estimators, report in-sample accuracies. 
Part 2: Random forest feature importance
Display the individual feature importance of your best model in Part 1 above using the code presented in Chapter 4 on page 136. {importances=forest.feature_importances_ }
Part 3: Conclusions
Write a short paragraph summarizing your findings. Answer the following questions:
a)What is the relationship between n_estimators, in-sample CV accuracy and computation time?
b)What is the optimal number of estimators for your forest?  
c)Which features contribute the most importance in your model according to scikit-learn function?  
d)What is feature importance and how is it calculated?  (If you are not sure, refer to the Scikit-Learn.org documentation.)
